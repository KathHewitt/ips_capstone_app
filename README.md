# React Frontend Application with Login and Search

This is a sample React frontend application that includes a login page and a search page. The application is designed to connect to a Django backend and interact with a MySQL database. This README file provides an overview of the project structure and instructions for setting up and running the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this application, ensure that you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js (v12 or later)
- npm (Node package manager)
- Django (v3 or later)
- MySQL

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up and run the React frontend application:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   
   git clone <repository-url>

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   cd react-frontend

2. Install the dependencies using npm:
   
  npm install

3. Create a .env file in the project root directory and specify the backend API endpoint. For example:

  REACT_APP_BACKEND_API=http://localhost:8000/api

  Replace http://localhost:8000/api with the actual URL where your Django backend is running.

4. Build the application:

    npm run build

    This command will generate a production-ready build of the React application in the build directory.

## Configuration

Before you can run the React frontend, you need to configure the Django backend and MySQL database. Follow the steps below:

    1. Set up a MySQL database and create the necessary tables. Refer to the Django documentation for detailed instructions.

    2. Update the Django backend configuration to connect to the MySQL database. Modify the DATABASES section in the settings.py file of your Django project. Make sure to provide the correct database credentials.

    3. Set up the Django server and ensure it is running properly.

## Running the Application

Once you have completed the installation and configuration steps, you can run the React frontend application by following these instructions:

    1. Start the development server:

    npm start

    This command will start a local development server at http://localhost:3000 and automatically open the application in your default browser.

    In the browser, you should see the login page of the application. Enter your credentials to log in.

    After successful login, you will be redirected to the search page. Here, you can search for items in the database using the provided search functionality.

## Folder Structure

The project structure of the React frontend application is as follows:

react-frontend/
  ├─ public/
  │   ├─ index.html
  │   └─ ...
  ├─ src/
  │   ├─ components/
  │   │   ├─ Login.js
  │   │   ├─ Search.js
  │   │   └─ ...
  │   ├─ services/
  │   │   ├─ api.js
  │   │   └─ ...
  │   ├─ App.js
  │   ├─ index.js
  │   └─ ...
  ├─ .env
  ├─ package.json
  └─ ...

    - The public directory contains the HTML template (index.html) and other static assets.
    - The src directory contains the main source code of the React application.
    - The components directory includes React components responsible for rendering the login and search pages.
    - The services directory provides API services to communicate with the Django backend.
    - The App.js file is the root component of the application, defining the overall structure.
    - The index.js file is the entry point of the application.
